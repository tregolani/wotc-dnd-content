			<p>A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and others instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.</p>

			<p> Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Art die.</p>
			<p>For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms’ appearance and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.</p>
			<p>While the astral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>

				<li>When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.</li>

			</ul>
